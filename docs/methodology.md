# Methodology

This document describes the methodology used in the satellite image classification project.

The project is divided into the following stages:
1. Baseline CNN model
2. Training improvements
3. Model explainability (saliency maps)
4. Image degradation and noise robustness
5. Robust CNN architecture (future work)
